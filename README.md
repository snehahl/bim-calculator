# BMI Calculator

## Project Description
The **BMI Calculator** is a tool designed to calculate a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. BMI is used to categorize individuals into different weight categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) and is an important health metric.

## Features
- Calculate BMI using the metric system (kg/m²)
- Calculate BMI using the imperial system (lb/in²)
- Displays BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity)
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Formula
- **Metric BMI formula:**
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
  \]
  
- **Imperial BMI formula:**
  \[
  \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (lb)} \times 703}{\text{Height (in)}^2}
  \]

## Categories:
- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5
- **Normal weight**: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
- **Overweight**: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
- **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 30
